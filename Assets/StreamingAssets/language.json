    "stage3Scene1TextBox7": "There are no numbers here at all.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox8": "We are going to need to collect all 12 numbered spheres.",

    "stage3Scene1TextBox15": "Let's explore and see if we can find some spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox16": "Excellent. Only 11 more to find.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox17": "Look down there, another path has opened up in front of the temple ruins.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox18": "Maybe we'll find the final spheres we need to complete the pattern puzzle and escape.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox19": "Excellent that's all 12 numbered spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox20": "Let's put them in the pedestal puzzle by the dock.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox21": "Do you remember the rule? Let's use that rule to place all the numbered spheres in the right order.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox22": "Something is not right. Let's try again. Reset the spheres with the button top left and try again.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox23": "Thats correct. The numbers increased by 3 each time and alternate even and odd. You did a fantastic job. Here comes the ship back to the mainland.",

    "stage3Scene1TextBox1": "We have arrived at the pattern ruins.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox2": "This is the last place we'll visit before getting the boat home.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox3": "There are no given rules here to find. Instead, we will observe a completed pattern and find the rule ourselves.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox4": "The first thing we need to do is examine the completed pattern in the temple ruins up ahead.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox5": "This is the dock, this is where the boat will come to pick you up. It looks like there's a pattern pedestal next to it.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox6": "Let's have a look.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox7": "There are no numbers here at all.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox8": "We are going to need to collect all 12 numbered spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox9": "We need to come back when we have analyzed the complete pattern and worked out the rule.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox10": "Here's the completed pattern. Let's see if we work out the rule in the pattern.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox11": "When you have figured out the rule. Press the close view button.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox12": "It appears to increase by a certain number each time.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox13": "Maybe we can count between each number and see if we can spot a pattern. Also the numbers appears to alternate between odd and even!",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox14": "It looks like a path has appeared up those steps.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox15": "Let's explore and see if we can find some spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox16": "Excellent. Only 11 more to find.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox17": "Look down there, another path has opened up in front of the temple ruins.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox18": "Maybe we'll find the final spheres we need to complete the pattern puzzle and escape.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox19": "Excellent that's all 12 numbered spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox20": "Let's put them in the pedestal puzzle by the dock.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox21": "Do you remember the rule? Let's use that rule to place all the numbered spheres in the right order.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox22": "Something is not right. Let's try again. Reset the spheres with the button top left and try again.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox23": "Thats correct. The numbers increased by 3 each time and alternate even and odd. You did a fantastic job. Here comes the ship back to the mainland.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox24": "Im going to stay here and guide others who wash up on the shore. It’s been amazing meeting you.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox25": "Thanks for all your help.",
