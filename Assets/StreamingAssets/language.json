    "stage2Scene2TextBox3": "Some of those platforms look unsteady. If we're gonna make it across we need to know the correct path.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox4": "Maybe that rule we found will help us.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox5": "Maybe we could find a rule in the previous room to help us.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox6": "Excellent. You found a rule that should help us get out of the temple.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox7": "Oh that was the wrong platform. Let's look at the rule and try again.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox8": "Well done you made it across.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox9": "There’s the pattern puzzle we need to solve to open the exit.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox10": "Let's take a closer look at it.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox11": "It's another growing pattern with new shapes. It looks like it's alternating shapes, colors, and amount of shapes in each row.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox12": "It appears to follow a similar pattern to the last temple. It looks like we're gonna need to find 3 different shapes.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox13": "Let's look around.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox14": "Fantastic. You found all 3 shapes. Let's head back to the puzzle and solve it.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox15": "That's incorrect! One or more shapes are in the wrong place. Remove the incorrect shape and try again.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox16": "Excellent. The pattern alternated shapes, colors and increased by 1 each row. A door has been opened to the island ruins. Well done!",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox17": "Let's open the inventory and add our shapes to complete the pattern.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox1": "We have arrived at the pattern ruins.",

    "stage3Scene1TextBox4": "The first thing we need to do is examine the completed pattern in the temple ruins up ahead. We should also look for the dock and the unfinished puzzle as well.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox5": "This is the dock, this is where the boat will come to pick you up. It looks like there's a pattern pedestal next to it.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox6": "Let's have a look.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox7": "There are no numbers here at all.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox8": "We are going to need to collect all 12 numbered spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox9": "We need to come back when we have analyzed the complete pattern in the temple and worked out the rule.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox10": "Here's the completed pattern. Let's see if we can work out the rule in the pattern.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox11": "When you have figured out the rule. Press the close view button.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox12": "It appears to increase by a certain number each time.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox13": "Maybe we can count between each number and see if we can spot a pattern. Also the numbers appear to alternate between odd and even!",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox14": "It looks like a path has appeared up those steps.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox15": "Let's explore and see if we can find some spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox16": "Excellent. Only 11 more to find.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox17": "Look down there, another path has opened up in front of the temple ruins.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox18": "Maybe we'll find the final spheres we need to complete the pattern puzzle and escape.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox19": "Excellent that's all 12 numbered spheres. Well done",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox20": "Let's put them in the pedestal puzzle by the dock.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox21": "Do you remember the rule from the completed puzzle at the start of the stage? Let's use that rule to place all the numbered spheres in the right order.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox22": "Something is not right. A numbered sphere is in the wrong place. Remove the wrong sphere by clicking it with the left mouse button and try again.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox23": "That's correct. The numbers increase by 3 each time and alternate odd and even. You did a fantastic job. Here comes the ship back to the mainland.",

    "stage2Scene1TextBox3a": "It appears to alternate colour and increase by one every diagonal row.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox3b": "We're going to need to find 2 different triangles to complete and carry on the pattern sequence. Let's go find them!",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox4": "There appears to be some boxes left here, I wonder what's in them.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox5": "Let's break them open. Press the E key to swing your stick and break the boxes.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox6": "Oh, a shape came out of that purple box. Let's collect it. These shapes are unlimited and can be used as many times as you need.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox7": "There should be 1 more purple box and 1 more shape to find.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox8": "Let's also keep an eye out for the given rule.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox9": "Oh good, you found the rule. We can look at it with the button on the top left.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox10": "That's all the shapes. Let's head back to the pattern puzzle.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox11": "Let's use the rule to fill in the missing shapes.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox12": "Ah, something is in the wrong place. Remove a shape by clicking it and try again.",
    "stage2Scene1TextBox13": "Excellent. The pattern alternates color and each diagonal line increases by 1 each time. A door has been opened to the next section of the temple. Well done!",
    "stage2Scene1ShapeBTriangle": "Blue Triangle",
    "stage2Scene1ShapeGTriangle": "Green Triangle",
    "stage2Scene2ShapeGPentagon": "Pentagon",
    "stage2Scene2ShapeGSquare": "Square",
    "stage2Scene2ShapeGDiamond": "Diamond",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox1": "It appears we're still in the Temple Of Shapes. Let's have a look around.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox2": "There is no rule in this area of the temple. We'll need to figure out the pattern rule ourselves.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox3": "Some of those platforms look unsteady. If we're gonna make it across we need to know the correct path.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox4": "Maybe that rule we found will help us.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox5": "Maybe we could find a rule in the previous room to help us.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox6": "Excellent. You found a rule that should help us get out of the temple.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox7": "Oh that was the wrong platform. Let's look at the rule and try again.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox8": "Well done you made it across.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox9": "There’s the pattern puzzle we need to solve to open the exit.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox10": "Let's take a closer look at it.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox11": "It's another growing pattern with new shapes. It looks like it's alternating shapes, colors, and amount of shapes in each row.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox12": "It appears to follow a similar pattern to the last temple. It looks like we're gonna need to find 3 different shapes.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox13": "Let's look around.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox14": "Fantastic. You found all 3 shapes. Let's head back to the puzzle and solve it.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox15": "That's incorrect, let's have another look at the rule and try again.",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox16": "Excellent. The pattern alternated shapes, colors and increased by 1 each row. A door has been opened to the island ruins. Well done!",
    "stage2Scene2TextBox17": "Let's open the inventory and add our shapes to complete the pattern.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox1": "We have arrived at the pattern ruins.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox2": "This is the last place we'll visit before getting the boat home.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox3": "There are no given rules here to find. Instead, we will observe a completed pattern and find the rule ourselves.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox4": "The first thing we need to do is examine the completed pattern in the temple ruins up ahead. We should also look for the dock and the unfinished puzzle as well.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox5": "This is the dock, this is where the boat will come to pick you up. It looks like there's a pattern pedestal next to it.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox6": "Let's have a look.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox7": "There are no numbers here at all.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox8": "We are going to need to collect all 12 numbered spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox9": "We need to come back when we have analyzed the complete pattern in the temple and worked out the rule.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox10": "Here's the completed pattern. Let's see if we can work out the rule in the pattern.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox11": "When you have figured out the rule. Press the close view button.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox12": "It appears to increase by a certain number each time.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox13": "Maybe we can count between each number and see if we can spot a pattern. Also the numbers appear to alternate between odd and even!",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox14": "It looks like a path has appeared up those steps.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox15": "Let's explore and see if we can find some spheres.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox16": "Excellent. Only 11 more to find.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox17": "Look down there, another path has opened up in front of the temple ruins.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox18": "Maybe we'll find the final spheres we need to complete the pattern puzzle and escape.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox19": "Excellent that's all 12 numbered spheres. Well done",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox20": "Let's put them in the pedestal puzzle by the dock.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox21": "Do you remember the rule from the completed puzzle at the start of the stage? Let's use that rule to place all the numbered spheres in the right order.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox22": "Something is not right. A numbered sphere is in the wrong place. Remove the wrong sphere by clicking it with the left mouse button and try again.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox23": "That's correct. The numbers increase by 3 each time and alternate odd and even. You did a fantastic job. Here comes the ship back to the mainland.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox24": "I'm going to stay here and guide others who wash up on the shore. It’s been amazing meeting you.",
    "stage3Scene1TextBox25": "Thank you for all your help.",
    "stage3Number1": "Number 1",
    "stage3Number4": "Number 4",
    "stage3Number7": "Number 7",
